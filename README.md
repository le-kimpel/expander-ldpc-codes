# expander-code-generator
Repo containing a few rudimentary scripts that will (ideally) generate a reasonable expander,
and play with the concept of generating expander codes.
This isn't particularly optimized, and most of the computations are for exploration/demonstration purposes only.

# How to run
from the console of your operating system of choice, run the following:

```
python3 standalone_examples/expandercode_basic.py
```

or

```
python standalone_examples/expandercode_basic.py
